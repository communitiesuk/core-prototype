      <p>Use this service to submit social housing lettings and sales data to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).</p>
      <p>We’ll ask you questions about a letting or sale, like details about the household or property. Your answers will create a log that you can submit directly to us.</p>
      <p>Your organisation can also:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>upload data for multiple lettings and sales</li>
        <li>transfer data using an API</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The data will be used to update the national record for social housing. It will also help to inform policy about the cost of social housing and what type of housing needs to be built.</p>
      <p>This service is only for social housing in England.</p>
