{% set markdown %}Social housing lettings and sales data is collected on behalf of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (DLUHC) for research and statistical purposes only. Data providers do not require the consent of tenants to provide the information, but tenants have the right to know how and for what purpose your data is being collected, held and used.

The processing must have a lawful basis. In this case the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest to meet a function of the Crown, a Minister of the Crown, or a government department.

You have the right to object and you have the right to obtain confirmation that your data is being processed, and to access your personal data. You also have the right to have any incorrect personal data corrected.

The information collected via this service relates to your tenancy, the dwelling you are living in or buying, and your household. Some of the information may have been provided by you as a tenant when signing the new tenancy or buying your property. Other information has been gathered from the housing management systems of social housing providers.

Data collected will be held for as long as necessary for research and statistical purposes. When no longer needed, data will be deleted in a safe manner.

We are aware that some of the data collected is particularly sensitive. For example:

* ethnic group
* if previous tenure is a hospital or prison or approved probation hostel support
* if household left last settled home because discharged from prison, a long stay hospital or other institution
* if source of referral is probation or prison, youth offending team, community mental health team or health service

All the information collected via this service is treated in accordance with data protection requirements and guidelines.

Data is published by DLUHC in aggregate form on an annual basis as part of a report and complementary tables.

You can visit www.gov.uk/government/collections/rents-lettings-and-tenancies to access the annual publications on lettings.

Or visit www.gov.uk/government/collections/social-housing-sales-including-right-to-buy-and-transfers to view the publications on sales.

The detail level data is anonymised and protected to minimise the risk of identification and held with the UK Data Archive for research purposes.

If you are unhappy with any aspect of this privacy notice, or how your personal information is being processed, contact the Department Data Protection Officer at: <dataprotection@communities.gsi.gov.uk>.

If you are still not happy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO) at [ico.org.uk/concerns](https://ico.org.uk/concerns).{% endset %}
